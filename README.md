# spectrum-expectations

⚠️ Warning: **Experimental!** WORK IN PROGRESS! ⚠️

This is an experiment to see if [Spectrum](https://github.com/greghaskins/spectrum) should follow a similar design/organization as [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) where the core, expectations, and matchers are all decoupled, yet complementary compoents. Their meta-gem includes all of them for getting started quickly.

Specifically, this repo focuses on the expectations/assertions library.
